                My name is Kyle LeBlanc and I have been a self taught developer currently living in Ottawa Ontario. I have been toying with the idea of becoming a developer for many years without a real commitment. I started college right out of high school for video game development but didn't complete it due to financial issues among others. To be completely honest, I wasn't ready right out of school I realize now. I have decided to return to school by taking online courses one at a time while working on the side, and building projects and the framework for my future businesses.

                I have completed CCPS109 Computer Science I in Python. I am preparing for a month or so before starting Discrete Math which will be difficult for me. Afterwards Computer Science II will be in Java.
